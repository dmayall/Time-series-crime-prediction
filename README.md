# Time-series-crime-prediction
This is a few models that I have made for another project that predicts the amount of crime in the next year of data 2016 using 2012-2015 and some predictors. The models used so far is an LSTM and ARIMA model. 

This is a project where I process, explore, and balance my data to produce a decently accurate models for this project. It was my first time working with time series data for predictions so making an LSTM and ARMIA models was a fun and new experience. If anyone has input on how I could have improved either model I would much appreciate any input. Also if nayone is interested in the data or needs it for running the file reach out to me since the files are too large for github to take. This project will probably get updated for a while since I enjoy it so much. I will add any updates below.
